##  closure

* What is a closure?<br>
* List two reasons why closures are useful<br>
* What is a module?<br>
* What is the arguments array-like object?<br>
* Why do we call arguments an array-like-object?<br>

* Write a function called createCounter. This function should contain a variable count that is initialized to 0. This function should return another function that when invoked, increments the counter by 1 and returns the count variable. You should be able to create multiple counters with the createCounter function and they should all have their own private variable called count.<br>
